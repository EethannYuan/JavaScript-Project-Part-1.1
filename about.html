            <h2>What you need to know about spa!</h2>
            <p>
                A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes seawater) is used to give medicinal baths. Spa towns 
                or spa resorts typically offer various health treatments, also known as balneotherapy. These practices have been popular worldwide.

            <p>
                The term is derived from the town of Spa, Belgium, known since Roman times. Some say it originated from the Latin word "spargere", 
                meaning sprinkle or moisten.

                Often performed at resorts, day spas, or beauty salons.
